# 🐚 Doshell Installation Guide

Doshell brings familiar DOS-style commands to modern Linux shells. Whether you're on WSL, Ubuntu, Fedora, or anything with Bash, Doshell helps bridge the muscle memory gap with intuitive aliases and enhancements.

## 🚀 Installation

Clone the repository:
  git clone https://github.com/twbaty/doshell.git
  cd doshell

Make the setup script executable and run it:
  chmod +x setup-doshell.sh
  ./setup-doshell.sh

Reload your shell:
  source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc

Verify installation by running:
  dir
  cls
  copy

🧠 Compatibility
Doshell is tested on System V–style Linux distributions using Bash and apt-based package management. It should work on any Linux system with a Bash-compatible shell. BSD-style or minimalist distros (e.g., Slackware, Alpine, FreeBSD) may require manual adaptation.

📦 Package Manager Detection (Coming Soon)
Future versions will auto-detect your distro’s package manager (apt, yum, dnf, pacman, etc.) and adjust install behavior accordingly.

🛠 Contributing
Pull requests welcome! If you’re using Doshell on a non-standard distro and have tweaks to share, we’d love to include them.
